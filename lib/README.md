THIS FOLDER IS A COPY
=====================

Content is sourced from https://github.com/apache/jena/tree/b0f24f4b9dc3860db67e69fc1161db661785191d/jena-arq/Grammar
Terms (Apache 2.0) as described in [header.jj](jena/jena-arq/Grammar/header.jj) apply!
(folder structure is preserved in the interest of maintainability)
  
If possible, retreiving these files automagically as development dependencies (scope: `test` in Maven lingo) is preferable, but I was not able to acheive this at the time of writing.
